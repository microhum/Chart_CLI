***We found that***

- Most plotting libraries are written in `C++` (It's hard to implement in `C` since no OOP)
- Most plotting libraries aren't designed to work in the terminal, so they often rely on image rendering programs to display graphs.

With this  `CLI` give you ability to **plot** your data into  ***lightweight** and **beautiful** command line* charts. Feeling like a senior cybersecurity dude 😎
